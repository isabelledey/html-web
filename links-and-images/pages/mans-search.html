    <h2>Man's Search For Meaning</h2>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      Man's Search for Meaning is a 1946 book by Viktor Frankl chronicling his
      experiences as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps during World War II,
      and describing his psychotherapeutic method, which involved identifying a
      purpose in life to feel positive about, and then immersively imagining
      that outcome.<br />
      According to Frankl, the way a prisoner imagined the future affected his
      longevity. The book intends to answer the question "How was everyday life
      in a concentration camp reflected in the mind of the average prisoner?"
      Part One constitutes Frankl's analysis of his experiences in the
      concentration camps, while Part Two introduces his ideas of meaning and
      his theory called logotherapy.

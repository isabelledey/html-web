    <h2>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</h2>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it." In his wildly
      popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it
      like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking
      today.<br />
      The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling,
      let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a
      generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson
      makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop
      jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons
      into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better.<br />
      Human beings are flawed and limited—"not everybody can be extraordinary,
      there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or
      your fault." Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept
      them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop
      running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to
      find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and
      forgiveness we seek.<br />
      There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to
      figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is
      nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true
      wealth is about experience. A much-needed
      grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk,
      filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle
      Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help
      them lead contented, grounded lives.

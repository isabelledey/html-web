    <h2>Stumbling on Happiness</h2>
    <h4>Description</h4>

        NATIONAL BESTSELLER - Bringing to life scientific research in
        psychology, cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, and behavioral
        economics, this witty, accessible book reveals what scientists have
        discovered about the uniquely human ability to imagine the future, and
        about our capacity to predict how much we will like it when we get
        there. <br />

        - Why are lovers quicker to forgive their partners for infidelity than
        for leaving dirty dishes in the sink? <br />

        - Why will sighted people pay more to avoid going blind than blind
        people will pay to regain their sight? <br />

        - Why do dining companions insist on ordering different meals instead of
        getting what they really want? <br />

        - Why do pigeons seem to have such excellent aim; why can't we remember
        one song while listening to another; and why does the line at the
        grocery store always slow down the moment we join it? <br />

        In this brilliant book, renowned Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert
        describes the foibles of imagination and illusions of foresight that
        cause each of us to misconceive our tomorrows and misestimate our
        satisfactions. With penetrating insight and sparkling prose, Gilbert
        explains why we seem to know so little about the hearts and minds of the
        people we are about to become.
